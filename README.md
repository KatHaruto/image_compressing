# Image Compressing with L1 regularization
I use L1 regularization in compressing image in JPEG format.

## implementation
JPEG has a high image compression ratio by cutting off high frequency components of the image.
Generally, high frequency components are not important for human recognition of images because they are the boundary areas of an image where colors shift significantly.

However, there are cases where JPEG is not a good choice.

In the jpeg image compression process, the high frequency components obtained by the discrete cosine transform(DCT) are reduced to zero by quantization.

I represented the discrete cosine coefficients and frequency components as a product of matrices and vectors, and used L1 regularization to find discrete cosine coefficients that have essential information and are still sparse.

## getting start

The image to be compressed must be square and its size must be divisible by 8.

```
$ python jpeg_sparse_modeling.py <filename>
```

## Expected Results
- New 5 files will be saved.
  - \<filename\>_jpeg_compressed.bmp  
    compressed image using conventional JPEG 
  - \<filename\>_jpeg_compressed_with_lasso(lambda=\<lambda\>).bmp Ã— 4  
    compressed image using JPEG + L1 regularization (ex. lambda = \[0.01, 0.1, 1, 5\])

- The following will be output to the console
